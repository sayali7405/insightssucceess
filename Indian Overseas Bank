Why Re-KYC Matters
The Know Your Customer (KYC) process is a fundamental aspect of modern banking. It helps financial institutions verify the identity of their customers, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and mitigating risks such as fraud and money laundering.
Re-KYC, in particular, is a periodic update of customer information to maintain accuracy and relevance. Traditionally, this has involved visiting bank branches, filling out forms, and submitting documents—an often time-consuming and cumbersome process. With the introduction of IOB’s Online Re-KYC, customers can now complete this critical process from the comfort of their homes, saving time and effort.
